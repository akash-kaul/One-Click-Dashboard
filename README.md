# One Click Dashboard - submission for TigerGraph Graphathon

## Brief Description:

You can watch a video explaining how the dashboard works [here](https://vimeo.com/454246874).

You can read a blog explining the dashboard in more detail [here](https://medium.com/swlh/deploy-a-full-stack-application-with-no-code-180c4d4e6fc8?source=friends_link&sk=3f1ac70dd5dee243fef329f94f1623d4).
