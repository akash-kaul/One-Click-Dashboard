# One Click Dashboard - submission for TigerGraph Graphathon

## Brief Description:
We created a Google Colab notebook that uses interactive widgets to allow a user to automatically launch an interactive dashboard (made with Streamlit) using the TigerGraph covid-19 startet kit

## Example Usage
To use the dashboard, follow these steps:
1. Create a TigerGraph account
2. Install the covid-19 starter kit
3. Load the data into the kit
4. Open the python notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
5. Run the notebook
6. Follow the prompts to enter your server information and click launch
7. Wait a couple minutes
8. Follow the link to your dashboard

It's that easy!
